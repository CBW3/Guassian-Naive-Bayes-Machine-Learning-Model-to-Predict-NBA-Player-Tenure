# Guassian-Naive-Bayes-Machine-Learning-Model-to-Predict-NBA-Player-Tenure
I use a Guassian Naive Bayes machine learning model to predict the tenure of NBA players.

In particular, I study whether or not an NBA player will exceed 5 years in the league. 

I produce a confusion matrix to visually explain my results. 

Moreover, I perform relevant statistical tests & analysis to interpret the findings of my ML model.
